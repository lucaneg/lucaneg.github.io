I am currently a Java and C# developer at [JuliaSoft](https://juliasoft.com/), where we develop the Julia static analyzer. 
My work at JuliaSoft goes beyond the simple software development: I am also part of the Scientific LAB, whose main focus is to bring the theoretical 
resesarch on Static analysis in contact with the industrial ecosystem. This led to a vast number of publications (see [here](https://juliasoft.com/resources/publications/))
and continues to bring contributions to the scientific community.

## <a name="cv"></a>SHORT CV

I started studying computer science in high school, continuing with both Bechelor's and Master's degree at the University of Verona. I got in touch with JuliaSoft during my Master's thesis, and that was the place where I fell for Abstract Interpretation. 
I joined JuliaSoft as a developer of the Julia static analyzer in April 2018. 

I also joined the Ca' Foscari University of Venice as a PhD student in Computer Science in October 2019, focusing on Static Analysis for the IoT ecosystem.

You can find my full CV [here](cv.pdf).

## <a name="myself"></a>ABOUT MYSELF

### Volleyball

I started playing volleyball when I was 14, and it is one of the best choices that I made in my entire life. 

### Music

I used to be a self-taught guitar player. I really enjoyed playing acoustic songs, and I hope to get back to that sooner or later.

### Astrophysics and Astrology

This is my newest interest, born mostly from growing curiosity after watching tons of youtube videos. I just can't get enough of reading and watching stuff!
