I am currently a Java and C# developer at JuliaSoft (part of the [Corvallis](http://www.corvallis.it/) group), where we develop the Julia static analyzer. 
My work at JuliaSoft goes beyond the simple software development: I am also part of the Scientific LAB, whose main focus is to bring the theoretical 
resesarch on Static analysis in contact with the industrial ecosystem. This led to a vast number of publications and continues to bring contributions to the scientific community.

[Recently](https://news.grammatech.com/grammatech-acquires-juliasoft), Julia has become part of [CodeSonar](https://www.grammatech.com/codesonar-cc), enabling a wider
impact on the Static Analysis market.

## <a name="cv"></a>SHORT CV

I started studying computer science in high school, continuing with both Bechelor's and Master's degree at the University of Verona. I got in touch with JuliaSoft during my 
Master's thesis, and that was the place where I fell for Abstract Interpretation. I joined JuliaSoft as a developer of the Julia static analyzer in April 2018. 

I also joined the Ca' Foscari University of Venice as a PhD student in Computer Science in October 2019, focusing on Static Analysis for the IoT ecosystem.

You can find my full CV [here](cv.pdf).

### LiSA

As part of my PhD research project, I started the development of LiSA, together with the [Software and System Verification group](https://ssv.dais.unive.it/) @ Caâ€™ Foscari 
University of Venice, Italy. LiSA (Library for Static Analysis) eases the creation and implementation of static analyzers based on the Abstract Interpretation theory. 
LiSA provides an analysis engine that works on a generic and extensible control flow graph representation of the program to analyze. Abstract interpreters in LiSA are 
built for analyzing such representation, providing a unique analysis infrastructure for all the analyzers that will rely on it. 

Building an analyzer upon LiSA boils down to writing a parser for the language that one aims to analyze, translating the source code or the compiled code towards the 
control flow graph representation of LiSA. Then, simple checks iterating over the results provided by the semantic analyses of LiSA can be easily defined to translate 
semantic information into warnings that can be of value for the final user. 

LiSA is distributed under the MIT license, and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/UniVE-SSV/lisa).

## <a name="myself"></a>ABOUT MYSELF

### Volleyball

I started playing volleyball when I was 14, and it is one of the best choices that I made in my entire life. 

### Music

I used to be a self-taught guitar player. I really enjoyed playing acoustic songs, and I hope to get back to that sooner or later.

### Astrophysics and Astronomy

This is my newest interest, born mostly from growing curiosity after watching tons of youtube videos. I just can't get enough of reading and watching stuff!
