<a name="intro"></a>
I am currently a Java and C# developer at [JuliaSoft](https://juliasoft.com/), where we develop the Julia static analyzer. 
My work at JuliaSoft goes beyond the simple software development: I am also part of the Scientific LAB, whose main focus is to bring the theoretical 
resesarch on Static analysis in contact with the industrial ecosystem. This led to a huge number of publications (see [here](https://juliasoft.com/resources/publications/))
an continues to bring contributions to the scientific community.
