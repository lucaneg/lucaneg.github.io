### Abstract

The European Union Data Act has been in force since 11 January 2024 to regulate the access and use of data and promote a more fair data sharing within the European Economic Area. This regulation could significantly impact blockchain technology, which can facilitate the secure exchange of data, leading to greater transparency, accountability, and auditability. However, compliance with the European Union Data Act may necessitate that blockchain solutions be adjusted accordingly. This paper aims at investigating the applicability and compatibility of blockchain technology with the European Union Data Act context, also considering aspects relevant for other related European regulations, directives, and strategies.
