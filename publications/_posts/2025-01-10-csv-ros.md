### Abstract

Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) is the de-facto standard framework for developing distributed robotic applications. However, ensuring the correctness and security of these applications remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to statically analyze ROS 2 applications using abstract interpretation. By extracting the architecture graph of the application, our method derives minimal access control policies that can be used to leverage security. We implemented our approach using the Library for Static Analysis (LiSA), providing a toolset that facilitates the development of sound static analyzers for ROS 2. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the security of ROS 2 applications.
