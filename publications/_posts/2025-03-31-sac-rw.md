### Abstract

Hyperledger Fabric is a well-known framework for developing enterprise blockchain solutions. Developers of these blockchains must ensure the correct execution of read and write operations so that the smart contracts' application logic is consistent with the business logic. In this paper, we present a static analysis approach based on abstract interpretation to detect read-write set issues in Hyperledger Fabric smart contracts and avoid bugs and critical errors that could compromise blockchain applications. The analysis is implemented in GoLiSA, a semantics-based static analyzer for Go applications. Our experimental results show that the proposed analysis can detect read-write set issues on a significant benchmark of existing applications. Moreover, it achieves better results in detecting read-after-write issues than other well-known open-source analyzers for Hyperledger Fabric smart contracts.
