### Abstract

Software verification aims to prove that a program satisfies some given properties for all its possible executions. Software evolved incredibly fast during the last century, exposing several challenges to this scientific discipline. The goal of the “Challenges of Software Verification Symposium” is to monitor the state-of-the-art in this field. This special issue of Software Tools for Technology Transfer presents novel theoretical directions and practical applications of these techniques. The papers in this special issue are extended versions of selected symposium papers from the proceedings of the 3rd Challenges of Software Verification Symposium (CSV), which took place at the Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, Venice, Italy, June 6–7, 2024.
